    n this task you are provided with two variables, quote and substring, which contain two strings. We would like you to:

    Retrieve the length of the quote, and store it in a variable called quoteLength.
    Find the index position where substring appears in quote, and store that value in a variable called index.
    Use a combination of the variables you have and available string properties/methods to trim down the original quote to "I do not like green eggs and ham.", 
    and store it in a variable called revisedQuote.
